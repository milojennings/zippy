vagrantbox.es has a list of vagrant boxes available

We will use this for now:
http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/precise/current/precise-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box

We may consider upgrading to the next Ubuntu LTS release when that arrives (14.04)


###################


current command set to get rockin' (you need: ansible, git, vagrant & virtualbox on the host machine):

git clone https://github.com/milojennings/zippy.git
cd zippy
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
vagrant box add precise64 http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/precise/current/precise-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box
vagrant up


###################

vagrant up only needs to be done once (unless you reboot), vagrant provision should be used if changes are made in ansible, use vagrant reload if changes are made to the Vagrantfile

note that vbguest will bark back an error:

  Installing the Window System drivers ...fail!
  (Could not find the X.Org or XFree86 Window System.)
  An error occurred during installation of VirtualBox Guest Additions 4.3.0. Some functionality may not work as intended.

There is nothing to worry about though, as our server is headless (no display server)
