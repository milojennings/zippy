0.3 release!
============
LORAX
2013.11.15


A milestone release! Complete restructuring of Ansible into roles!

Provisioning is now fully idempotent!

Also the first release using the geiselTag naming scheme!


0.2 release!
============
2013.11.12

Zippy now deploys to live servers!


0.1 release!
============
2013.11.07

Things are far from perfect but stable enough to release at this point. 
  
  Pomander is handling all wordpress provisioning, including the database creation.

  Once ansible 1.4.x comes out we will be running off of only stable releases.

Now we will begin to test deployment to other providers.
